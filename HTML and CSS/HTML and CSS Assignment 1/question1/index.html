            He’s a 16-time World Champion, New York Times best-selling author
            and record-setting Make-A-Wish granter. He’s released a hit album,
            starred in blockbuster movies and carried the torch for WWE since
            he first set foot in a WWE ring nearly two decades ago. If you really
            can’t see John Cena at this point, chances are you simply aren’t looking.
            Was there any doubt Cena would become the living legend he is today?
            You practically knew you were glimpsing the future “Face That Runs the Place”
            when a muscular Massachusetts kid threw down with Kurt Angle for a chance
            to become a true WWE Superstar. Sure enough, a little ruthless aggression
            went a long way. After gaining the respect of his peers by stepping to The
            Olympic Hero, Cena went supernova as the fire-spitting Doctor of Thuganomics,
            eventually reaching the peak by upending JBL for his first WWE Championship
            at WrestleMania 21.
