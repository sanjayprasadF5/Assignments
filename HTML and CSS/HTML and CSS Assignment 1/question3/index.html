        <h1>
            Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is one of the most
                famous people in the world today and he has worked a
                lot for it. Since his WWE debut in 1996, The Rock has
                gained the popularity that many people strive for.
                From a multi-time champion to a blockbuster movie star, The
                Rock has literally earned it all. Just put his name in a
                movie, that movie will be a hit. Play his theme song in a
                wrestling arena and the fans will go crazy.
                Not even a single person will be heard booing this legend.

                However, behind every success story,
                there is a story of struggle. And while we might not know much
                about the struggles that Dwayne faced when he started his career,
                we do know that he went through a lot and this is clear by the
                things he says. Mr. Johnson knows how to motivate people not only
                with his actions but also with the things he says.
                The Brahma Bull has helped a lot of people by being a mentor for
                them such as his cousin, Roman Reigns.

        <h1>“Blood, Sweat, and Respect.
            First Two You Give.
            The Last One You Earn.”</h1>
        <p> The Brahma Bull makes a bold and hard-hitting
            statement here. You will eventually receive the respect
            you deserve and desire. The key is to put your heart in
            it and work with everything you have got. Just believe in
            yourself and do whatever you have to do to realize your
            dreams. Dwayne uses Blood and Sweat here as metaphors
            for hard work and determination. So, you’ll receive the
            respect that you deserve if you work with pure hard work
            and determination.

            <h1>“In 1995, I had 7 Bucks In My Pocket. I Knew Two Things:
                I’m Broke As Hell and One Day I Won’t Be.”</h1>
            <p> Being broke is a tough thing to digest and
                it’s a point where a person feels at his lowest.
                I can relate to this because even I’ve been broke
                at many points in my life. Dwayne says that he had
                only $7 in his pocket on a day in 1995 and he knew
                two things at that time: he was broke and one day
                he won’t be. What came the following year? His WWE
                debut on Survivor Series and the rest is history.
                The Rock knew that he won’t be broke one day and
                today, he is the second richest wrestler in the world,
                after Vince McMahon but we all know that he owns
                WWE. What we can learn from this is that
                we must never lose hope, even if we are at our lowest.
